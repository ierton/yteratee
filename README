Yet another iteratee clone. Currently, only part of original interface is
supported.

Main purpose to start this project was difficulties in writing of relatively
sophisticated parser of dvb stream using existing libraries. I tried to use 
iteratees, but gave up to implement error-recovering correctly.

Main differences from the original iteratees are:

- Does not treat empty stream in a special way
- Only one type of errors with easy to use recovering facilities
- Cleaner code, easier to check
- Less tested

Lots of code (almost all tests) were borrowed from iteratee and binary-strict
projects.

Many Thanks to
